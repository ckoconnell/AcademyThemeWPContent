                <p>The Squamish Access Society is dedicated to working on behalf of climbers to protect public access to the climbing areas of the greater Squamish region, to engage as responsible stewards of the climbing environment and to advocate for access to quality self-propelled recreation. We work together with other access groups in “on the ground” initiatives and in engaging with local and provincial government and the private sector on behalf of climbers. Our work encompasses all the major climbing disciplines.</p>

                <img src="http://localhost/climbingacademydev/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/access-society-logo.gif" class="climbersAccess" />
                <p>The Access Society represents everyone who supports public access to the cliffs and mountains of B.C., and conservation of them. It was founded in 1995. We encourage anyone who supports our goals, particularly all climbers and mountaineers, to become involved, and support our work.</p>
                <p>The Access Society works on climbing issues as they relate to:</p>
                <ul>
                     <li>Management of parks, and of public lands outside parks.</li>
                    <li>Real and perceived environmental impacts, and their management.</li>
                    <li>Access to undeveloped private land, and related legal issues.</li>
                    <li>Conflicting recreational, commercial and industrial users.</li>
                    <li>Arbitrary or unreasonable use fees.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that those supporting public access to our mountains and cliffs are represented by a single, effective, inclusive body - the Access Society.</li>
                </ul>
