            <h3>The Boom Booms</h3>
            <p>The Boom Booms are an Indie Soul band from Vancouver, BC. The group consists of brothers Aaron Ross (lead vocals) and Sean Ross (keys), Tom Van Deursen (guitar), Geordie Hart (bass), Richard Brinkman (drums), and Theo Vincent (percussion, drums).</p>
            <p>The Boom Booms love and live for the road. They’ve busked across Europe, performed in the Brazilian Amazon and Rio’s famous ‘Casa Rosa’, toured in a Scamper RV the 12,000 km roundtrip from Vancouver to Panama and circumnavigated the United States twice in their yellow School Bus.</p>
            <p>Influenced by travel, the Booms released their latin-laced debut album ¡Hot Rum! in 2011. Their sophomore release with Grammy Award-winning producer Chin Injeti “Love Is Overdue” came out Oct. 4th 2014, and draws more on childhood influences such as Bill Withers and Al Green.</p>

            <h2>Saturday July 11th @ 8:00 PM</h2>
            <h3>Jon and Roy</h3>
            <p>The duo arrived in 2005 almost fully formed, with a foundation built upon Middleton's unique approach to the acoustic guitar and Vizer's original rhythmic patterns. Their debut, Sittin' Back, proved to be the beginning of a steady ascent that took flight with 2008's Another Noon. </p>
            <p>The album's catchy title track was featured in a Volkswagen TV commercial that ran for nine months across the USA, giving the group considerable profile in that country. The success of the album (which also spawned the YouTube hit, Little Bit of Love) led to new fans and substantial critical acclaim for the pair, who toured everywhere in support of the release.</p>
