            <p>Come get your groove on after each evening of key note speakers up at the Sea to Sky Gondola.</p>
            <h2>Friday July 10th @ 8:00 PM</h2>
            <h3>The Boom Booms</h3>
            <p>The Boom Booms are an Indie Soul band from Vancouver, BC. The group consists of brothers Aaron Ross (lead vocals) and Sean Ross (keys), Tom Van Deursen (guitar), Geordie Hart (bass), Richard Brinkman (drums), and Theo Vincent (percussion, drums).</p>
            <p>The Boom Booms love and live for the road. They’ve busked across Europe, performed in the Brazilian Amazon and Rio’s famous ‘Casa Rosa’, toured in a Scamper RV the 12,000 km roundtrip from Vancouver to Panama and circumnavigated the United States twice in their yellow School Bus.</p>
            <p>Influenced by travel, the Booms released their latin-laced debut album ¡Hot Rum! in 2011. Their sophomore release with Grammy Award-winning producer Chin Injeti “Love Is Overdue” came out Oct. 4th 2014, and draws more on childhood influences such as Bill Withers and Al Green.</p>

            <h2>Saturday July 11th @ 8:00 PM</h2>
            <h3>Jon and Roy</h3>
            <p>The duo arrived in 2005 almost fully formed, with a foundation built upon Middleton's unique approach to the acoustic guitar and Vizer's original rhythmic patterns. Their debut, Sittin' Back, proved to be the beginning of a steady ascent that took flight with 2008's Another Noon. </p>
            <p>The album's catchy title track was featured in a Volkswagen TV commercial that ran for nine months across the USA, giving the group considerable profile in that country. The success of the album (which also spawned the YouTube hit, Little Bit of Love) led to new fans and substantial critical acclaim for the pair, who toured everywhere in support of the release.</p>

            <h2>Sunday July 12th @ 5:00 PM</h2>
            <h3>Kane & Potvin</h3>
            <p>Bryan Potvin (The Northern Pikes) and Kevin Kane (The Grapes Of Wrath) to play a handful of duo dates together in western Canada this July!</p>
            <p>From the mid-80s to the early-90s, The Grapes Of Wrath and The Northern Pikes were responsible for some of the catchiest and most heart-felt singles and videos to come out of Canada at that time.  Fast forward some 20 years later and the vocalist/guitarists from each of these bands find themselves living just blocks away from one another in Toronto. This realization led to the two of them getting together to hang out with a couple of guitars for some casual jams, and the conclusion: "This sounds good! Let's do some shows!"</p>
